# Personal Portfolio
By sharing my portfolio on GitHub, I aim to demonstrate my ability to develop skills and ability as a data scientist and a problem solver. This repository is a living document that I will update regularly as I continue to develop my skills and undertake new projects, providing a comprehensive overview of my coding abilities and accomplishments.
